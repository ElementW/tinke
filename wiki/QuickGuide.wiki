=Actions=

To see a file (the palette, or the animation given by a file), you must select the file and click in the _See_ button. Some files requires other informations from other files in order to create the final resource, some of them are:
 * Image: Requires a palette.
 * Screen: Requires an image (and a palette)
 * Cells: Requires an image (and a palette)
 * Animation: Requires cells and an image (and a palette)

In order to save in the memory this information, to create later other resource, you have two method:
 # Click the *See* button. You'll see the actual data from this file and if it's possible it will save in the memory.
 # *Double-click* a file in the file tree. If it's possible the information given by the file will be saved.
These data will be saved but won't be used in the moment, that is, if you save a Screen information it won't modify the image until you click the _See_ button and if you save a different Screen information it will modify the original image (not the image modified by the older Screen data).
Anyway if you want to delete some of these saved data you just need click into the _Delete chain_ buttons.
